## Why

Talk about what problem this solves, what SDG(s) and SGD targets it addresses and why these are imoirtant

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 8: DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH

Proposed solution
In the problem statement, to 'spot' meant to be able to 'identify or come to a realization'; thus,
it reads ''Try to find a solution which helps both parents and children to identify or come to a
realization the dangers of modern slavery, trafficking and child labor.'' The statement also
pointed out the current mode of information dissemination to curb child trafficking by
investigators (journalists, ministry of gender, NGO’s etc) to be primarily social media based, the
problem statement wanted to point out that it is not enough; more avenues need to be added.
That is why it went on to give clue about a possible solution, lack of direct “lack of direct
interaction from the victims itself, makes it more difficult for investigators to provide support.”
Here, it is trying to tell us to create a solution that enables investigators get direct interaction
with victims and parents, thus, the victims should have an avenue where their voice will be heard.
This avenue will enable the trafficked children share their personal experiences with investigators
and other people who are ready to help fight against this abuse. The possible media to use will
include print and community outreach to create awareness and improve sensitization of locals
within the child trafficking zones on the dangers and legal issues involved. When trafficked
children are able to be given the voice, they will have more influence on parents within these
trafficking prone zones.
Some parents who have their wards living with other people may have no idea of the kind of
treatment been given to their wards; some also are very much aware of what is happening but
do not really know the dangers involved. When the children are able to have interaction directly
with these parents, it will bring to their realization the main events that go on, since it is coming
from a child who has experienced the situation.
The children who are rescued from child trafficking should be incorporated into the fight against
trafficking; to enhance the works of investigators. Other children who may have the intent of
indulging in such practices will also come to realize the real-life dangers involved. This text from
the PS “kids are unaware of what's happening, while their parents are also involved to some
extent.” Means that most of the time, the children involved do not know that they are being
taken through a criminal activity (child trafficking), hence they succumb to the maltreatments
and harsh daily activities without complain.


## Usage
TECH SOLUTION (2 APPS TO BE BUILT):

APP 1 (for general public)
The app will also feature the ability for people to report anonymously any case of child trafficking
which they are currently witnessing to the authorities. The app will allow them to share:
Wilson
• Town, community where the activity is going on, names and residential location of
perpetrators, precise/specific location eg. Lake volta, river Densu, or if unknown
correspondence location may be entered.
The report lodged will be sent as notification or SMS to the various stakeholders beforehand.
When the stakeholders receive notifications, they can open to app to view reports lodged by
various people and also click to read more information about specific reports. This will allow swift
action of the security forces to take hold and rescue the children and prosecute perpetrators.
So, the app works like a ‘messaging app’, where the general public becomes the ‘senders’ and
the stakeholders become the ‘receivers.’

APP 2 (for stakeholders)
One app that is able to keep track of rescued children, through database information storage.
The app servers communicate directly with institutional servers of government stakeholders.
One of the main challenges identified by the Ministry of Gender, Children & Social welfare, is lack
of proper information dissemination and sharing between various stakeholders. So, the app will
only be an information gathering tool, which will feed the various stakeholders the required
details and information needed to take necessary action. The app will take in:
• Photograph of rescued children, name, age, sex, where he/she was rescued from,
hometown, how many children were with him/her during the time of slavery, type of
activity involved in during slavery, talents/special hobbies.
This various information gathered will help the investigators and stakeholders met out specific
strategies to help the rescued children. Not all of them will love to go to school, through
knowledge of their hobbies and talents, they can be given basic education and then enrolled in a
handy-work depending on their talents, that way helping to curb rate of unemployment. The
information will also be used to identify other hot zones and allow police and other security
agencies to perform mass rescue of victimized children and prosecution of guardians who
perpetrate these acts.
This app will also receive report updates from the general public who want to report cases of
child trafficking which they witness in their locality.
These kids upon successfully going through their rehab centers, will not just be released to go,
but to also help in the fight against the canker. They will actively be involved in outreach programs
to help share their life experiences with parents and children alike.


## Setup

Install `npm` or `yarn` if you dont have any of them already installed. We recommend Yarn though.

After clonning the repo to your local machine and moving into the cloned folder, Run `yarn install` to get started by installing dependencies. 

`src/index.js` is the entry to the project and source code should go into the `src` folder.

All tests should be written in the `__tests__' folder. There's a sample in there.

This starter uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html) as the bundler. It is much simpler that WebPack and the others

#### Hints

- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to get started. We'll assume you are using Yarn.
- Install additional dependencies: `yarn add <dependency-name> [-D]`
- Run tests: `yarn test`
- Run tests with test coverage info: `yarn test:cover`
- Check the codebase for proper syntax and formatting compliance: `yarn lint`
- Run your app in local dev mode: `yarn start`. This puts the bundled app in a `dist` folder, set up a local web server at localhost:1234, and continues to watch for your code changes which it syncs with the local server. This means if you loaded the app in a browser, it will auto-refresh as you code along. Feel free to use whatever bundler best meets your needs. Parcel was only added as a sample and for those looking for a simple but effective solution to the hassle of bundlers.

## Contributing
If this project sounds interesting to you and you'd like to contribute, thank you!
First, you can send a mail to buildforsdg@andela.com to indicate your interest, why you'd like to support and what forms of support you can bring to the table, but here are areas we think we'd need the most help in this project :
1.  area one (e.g this app is about human trafficking and you need feedback on your roadmap and feature list from the private sector / NGOs)
2.  area two (e.g you want people to opt-in and try using your staging app at staging.project-name.com and report any bugs via a form)
3.  area three (e.g here is the zoom link to our end-of sprint webinar, join and provide feedback as a stakeholder if you can)
